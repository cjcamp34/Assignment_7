<h4><p class = "Hide Paragraphs">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spelman’s graduation rate (77 percent) is in the top five of colleges in Georgia and more than 30 percentage points higher than the national completion rate for African-American students in private institutions. Spelman is well above the national graduation rate (44 percent) for African American students. Spelman is among the most selective women’s college in the nation. Spelman educates the highest number (at 43) of Gates Millennium Scholars than any other college or university in the country.
    </p>
<p class="Hide Paragraphs"> One-third of our students enter graduate or professional school immediately after college graduation, resulting in Spelman being one of the nation's leading producers of Black female medical students and doctoral candidates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Spelman has been recognized by the National Science Foundation as the leading producer of Black women who go on to earn doctorates in the sciences. </p>

Spelman produces more black women who complete Ph.D.s in STEM fields than any other U.S. institution. A recent poll published in the New York Times demonstrated that students who attended Spelman experienced robust social mobility.
